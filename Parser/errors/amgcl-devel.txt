CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (cmake_policy):
  Policy CMP0058 may not be set to OLD behavior because this version of CMake
  no longer supports it.  The policy was introduced in CMake version 3.3.0,
  and use of NEW behavior is now required.

  Please either update your CMakeLists.txt files to conform to the new
  behavior or use an older version of CMake that still supports the old
  behavior.  Run cmake --help-policy CMP0058 for more information.


CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:31 (find_package):
CMake Deprecation Warning at docs/CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.
